<h1>DOM (Document Object Model)</h1>

<p>
    By using Dom, we can interact with a browser like chaning or adding content, making a pop-up effect in the web page, etc.
</p>

<p>The DOM describes an HTML page as a hierarchical tree of nodes.</p>

<p>
    The root node is the HTML tag and it contains the head tag (node) and the body tag (node), and the body node contains some other nodes such as p tag, div tag, etc.
